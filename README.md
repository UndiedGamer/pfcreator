The helpers folder will be rewritten in rust (because there isnt a docx library in C/Zig) so bear with no Documentation for now.

A reminder to myself is to change the file paths for format.yml to be in the project directory.

# NOTE
There is no 1:1 command of `script` on unix, so the inputs are not captured, you either have to edit it manually yourself or use a unix based shell on windows like wsl/cygwin/mysy2.
